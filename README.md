# Miscellaneous
This respository is a space for me to dump codes. 80% of these are beginner projects I did when I was 14-15, which should explain the monstrosity of the code scripts. 

### A simple breakdown of the folders

###### Data Analysis & Science

Snippets of an imaginary organisation I thought of bringing alive, the International Moving Astronomy Gallery.
