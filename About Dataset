ABOUT DATASET

The following table shows close approaches to the Earth by near-Earth objects (NEOs). Data are not available prior to
1900 A.D. nor after 2200 A.D. Data are further limited to encounters with reasonably low uncertainty.

Object primary designation

Close-Approach (CA) Date:
Date and time (TDB) of closest Earth approach.

CA Distance Nominal (au):
The most likely (Nominal) close-approach distance in astronomical units.

CA Distance Minimum (au):
The minimum possible close-approach distance (Earth center to NEO center), in astronomical units.

V relative (km/s):
Object velocity relative to Earth at close-approach.

V infinity (km/s):
Object velocity relative to a massless Earth at close-approach.

H (mag):
Asteroid absolute magnitude (in general, smaller H implies larger asteroid diameter). Undefined for comets.

Diameter:
Diameter value when known or a range (min - max) estimated.

Rarity:
A measure of how infrequent the Earth close approach is for asteroids of the same size and larger:
    0 means an average frequency of 100 per year
    1 corresponds to roughly once a month
    2 to roughly once a year
    3 to roughly once a decade, etc.
    'n/a' means that a frequency estimate is not available. See note for details.


EXTRA

One Astronomical Unit (au) is approximately 150 million kilometers (see glossary for definition).
One Lunar Distance (LD) is approximately 384,000 kilometers (see glossary for definition).
